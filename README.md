# Swing in Hamburg

This data was collected for social network analysis at eight different swing dance events in Hamburg/Germany from 24th of May to 5th of July in 2012. 

Participants received a short questionnaire and a set of tokens in form of 20 plastic coins (in a sealed plastic bag) that had been coded as to allow for unambiguous assignment. Participants were asked to exchange one token per dance with every dance partner, and to return questionnaire and tokens before leaving the event. 

By sorting the tokens after the event it was possible to retrace interaction between event's participants. The questionnaire included a pseudonymous id that allowed to identify participants over the course of the data collection period. 

Analysis and interpretation of the data has been published in my diploma thesis with the title “Die Hamburger Swingtänzer des frühen 21. Jahrhunderts : Sozialnetzwerkanalyse einer Subkultur” at the Universität Hamburg.
