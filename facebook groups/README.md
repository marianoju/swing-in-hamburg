# Facebook groups

This data describes connections between facebook users with membership in swing-dance-related groups. 

The original data was extracted from 450 swing dance related Facebook groups with Netvizz in late September 2013. Data has been concatenated, compressed and anonymized (five-digit hexadecimal user id). Edges represent “friendship” relations between users. Data contains only unique nodes and edges (no duplicates). Data includes isolate nodes! 

Visualization and exploration of network data has been done with [Gephi](https://gephi.org/). 

- No. of nodes: 137,218 
- No. of edges: 2,538,069 

After removal of isolate nodes (Degree = 0): 
- No. of nodes: 115,382  
- No. of edges: 2,538,069 

Clusters have been computed and are represented by color.
